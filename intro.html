        <p>
            Hanok is a building built in Korea with our own technology and style since prehistoric times.
            The origin of the hanok is a hut in the early Neolithic period around 6,000 BC, and it is believed that traditional hanok was completed in the late Joseon Dynasty.
            Hanok was completely combined with ondol, floor, and kitchen to have a close relationship with each yard and differentiate into various regional types.

        <p>
            Hanok was built in accordance with the theory of divination and acceptance according to feng shui.
            The most ideal location for a hanok is to build it south facing the water with its back against the mountain in the back.
            Hanok has little pollution from modern architecture. Most of the materials used in hanok are recyclable.
            Because it is made of only natural materials such as wood and soil.
            Stones and trees were used in a natural state that was not artificially processed. It is not toxic, so it is not harmful to the human body and does not damage the base to build a building.

        <p>
            Hanok is a traditional Korean house that has developed independently.
            <br>
            Hanok uses eco-friendly materials to build houses to blend in with the surrounding nature,
            which contains the ideals of ancestors who valued harmony between nature and humans.
            In addition, traditional hanoks are made by assembling only wood without any particular fixture.
            The elaborate prefabricated house protects the beautiful curves and beauty of the hanok.

            And Hanok has adjusted the temperature of the house with ondol and eaves to match the climate of our country, which is cold in winter and hot and rainy in summer.
